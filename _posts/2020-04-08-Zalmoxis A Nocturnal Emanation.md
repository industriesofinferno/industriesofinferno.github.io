excerpt: A Nocturnal Emanation is a release with somnambulistic themes, grand sweeping atmospheres, a gnarled expedition into nocturnal mysteries.

There is something deeply satisfying when the visual, textual and audio components of a work of art blend seamlessly – the sign of a well-sculpted vision. That is the case with the third release of Germany’s **Zalmoxis**, *A Nocturnal Emanation*, where title, music and cover art create the mirage of a disturbing oscillation through darkness – a dream. Even the creator’s alias, Entheogen (the person also responsible for [A Binding Spirit](https://abindingspirit.bandcamp.com/releases){:.text-blue-600 .hover:text-blue-400}, [Fortress of the Olden Days](https://fortressoftheoldendays.bandcamp.com/releases){:.text-blue-600 .hover:text-blue-400}, and [Ås](https://dasaas.bandcamp.com/){:.text-blue-600 .hover:text-blue-400}), serves the concept.

Zalmoxis play finespun, gloomy black metal with a strong emphasis on atmosphere. The cavernous production aesthetics create a spacious cocoon in which the listener is immersed, **akin to entering a dream incubation sanctuary of old**, with the finespun guitar melodies as occasional, flickering guides. The riffs mostly dissolve into an almost keyboard-y impressionist essence, hazy, soaring, **bleeding into the soundscape**. When they do tighten up they are of a majestic countenance, drawing upon the timeless font of early **Limbonic Art**.

In contrast to the varied but ultimately unsurprising black metal rasps and whispers that haunt the album, the commanding clean female vocals that appear occasionally are of a **deeply numinous character**, somewhat reminiscent of their counterparts in **Absu**’s *Sun of Tiphareth*.

The ritual character is unpretentious and deeply felt here; as a result **this is music to be immersed into, not be followed rationally**. It lacks a tight structure, its boundaries are obscure, and it is extremely hard to isolate specific parts – even more so to remember them after listening.

Graced with an amazing cover (crying out for a tape release) by the Russian [Morkh](https://www.facebook.com/nethertemple616/){:.text-blue-600 .hover:text-blue-400}, somewhat reminiscent in style of **David Herrerias**’ work for [Akhlys](https://www.metal-archives.com/images/5/0/5/9/505997.jpg?1909){:.text-blue-600 .hover:text-blue-400} and [Nightbringer](https://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Nightbringer/Ego_Dominus_Tuus/443490){:.text-blue-600 .hover:text-blue-400}, A Nocturnal Emanation is a release with somnambulistic themes, grand sweeping atmospheres, **a gnarled expedition into nocturnal mysteries**. Worthy of the name of [a shamanic divinity of ancient Balkans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zalmoxis){:.text-blue-600 .hover:text-blue-400}, the band here fits well the theme of [Andrew Chumbley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_D._Chumbley){:.text-blue-600 .hover:text-blue-400}’s Hypnagogia: **the meeting place of sleeping, dreaming and waking**.
