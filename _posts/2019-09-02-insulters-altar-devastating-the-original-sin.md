excerpt: Kind of a tour-de-force of the ideal late ’90s Norse sound, like Tsjuder had done in Desert Northern Hell.

* **How it sounds:** through a Kampfar lens, traces of thrashing inferno and De Mysteriis riffage, ridge-like lines riffs, hints of dissonance, slightly flirting with ritual atmosphere, rehearsal atmosphere, gnarly vocals
{:.list-inside .list-disc}  
* **How it feels:** assimilated are the pillars of Norsk Svart Metall, a drakkar moving steadily through ice covered seas, furious, turbulent, great tape cover and logo
{:.list-inside .list-disc}  
* **Sounds like:** Kampfar, Ondskapt, Tsjuder, Norsk Svart Metall
{:.list-inside .list-disc}  
* **Shortcomings:** oscillating songwriting quality, not reaching their full potential
{:.list-inside .list-disc}  
* **Verdict:** Kind of a tour-de-force of the ideal late ’90s Norse sound, somewhat like Tsjuder had done in Desert Northern Hell. The 2 tracks that appeared first (Desecration of the Light and Queen of Flesh) remain the best of the bunch. Good potential, it being their first demo and all.
