After a 3 year silence, Belgium’s Cult Of Erinyes, responsible for the rather spectacular “Blessed Extinction,” return with the “Transcendence” EP, a 3 piece release, containing two original tracks, and one cover of Mayhem’s “Pagan Fears,” clocking something less than 20 minutes. Graced with an amazing cover art, and cassette being its only physical format (just 100 copies), “Transcendence” conveys something of the underground black metal’s obscurity, even package-wise. On to the audio department, the band’s new tracks showcase a return to more traditional, archaic black metal forms, the first (“Degrees Of Solitude”) being a serpentine corpus of nefarious mid-tempo and occult hyper-speed riffing, somehow reminiscent of the early ’00s Swedish scene (Ondscapt, Watain, etc). The second one, “Transcendence,” is more on the mid-tempo side, somehow “trekking” in its rhythm, a gaze through bars as you are lowered towards the oblivion of the Abyss (“remember my name” echoes time and again). Top-notch vocals and atmosphere, while guitar riffs may not be hugely innovative, but work well enough as far as the creation of an occult transcendental haze is concerned. “Pagan Fears’” rendition is close to the original, with no surprises, but quite welcome, with just a hint of extra vehemence. All in all an enjoyable but unfortunately short release, which intensifies the wait for the next full-length.
