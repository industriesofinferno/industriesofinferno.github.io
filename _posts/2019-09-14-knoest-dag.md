excerpt: Graced with an good baritone frontman who raises the majestic and emotional bar, the album captures in a skilled way the spirit of forest wandering.

* **How it sounds:** atmospheric in a Nordic way, sylvan, heroic, adventurous, marching, autumnal, deep clean sonorous vocals at the forefront, raging Enslaved moments, lots of folkish acoustic moments, hints of post-punk rhythms (listen to track 3, [Avond](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGc5gUWrJh4){:.text-blue-600 .hover:text-blue-400})
{:.list-inside .list-disc}  
* **How it feels:** nostalgic, wandering, past glories, impressionistic, naturalistic, [hiraeth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiraeth){:.text-blue-600 .hover:text-blue-400}
{:.list-inside .list-disc}  
* **Sounds like:** first-era Enslaved (especially the blasting moments), first-era Ulver, Borknagar, Empyrium, slight traces of epic Bathory.
{:.list-inside .list-disc}  
* **Shortcomings:** songwriting could be more robust, some rasping vocals would fit nicely with the faster parts
{:.list-inside .list-disc}  
* **Verdict:** Graced with an good baritone frontman who raises the majestic and emotional bar, the album captures in a skilled way the spirit of forest wandering (which apparently was the conceptional seed of the record). Solid pagan naturalistic black metal.
