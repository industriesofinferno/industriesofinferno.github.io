I"®<p>There is something deeply satisfying when the visual, textual and audio components of a work of art blend seamlessly â€“ the sign of a well-sculpted vision. That is the case with the third release of Germanyâ€™s <strong>Zalmoxis</strong>, <em>A Nocturnal Emanation</em>, where title, music and cover art create the mirage of a disturbing oscillation through darkness â€“ a dream. Even the creatorâ€™s alias, Entheogen (the person also responsible for <a href="https://abindingspirit.bandcamp.com/releases" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-400">A Binding Spirit</a>, <a href="https://fortressoftheoldendays.bandcamp.com/releases" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-400">Fortress of the Olden Days</a>, and <a href="https://dasaas.bandcamp.com/" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-400">Ã…s</a>), serves the concept.</p>

<p>Zalmoxis play finespun, gloomy black metal with a strong emphasis on atmosphere. The cavernous production aesthetics create a spacious cocoon in which the listener is immersed, <strong>akin to entering a dream incubation sanctuary of old</strong>, with the finespun guitar melodies as occasional, flickering guides. The riffs mostly dissolve into an almost keyboard-y impressionist essence, hazy, soaring, <strong>bleeding into the soundscape</strong>. When they do tighten up they are of a majestic countenance, drawing upon the timeless font of early <strong>Limbonic Art</strong>.</p>

<p>In contrast to the varied but ultimately unsurprising black metal rasps and whispers that haunt the album, the commanding clean female vocals that appear occasionally are of a <strong>deeply numinous character</strong>, somewhat reminiscent of their counterparts in <strong>Absu</strong>â€™s <em>Sun of Tiphareth</em>.</p>

<p>The ritual character is unpretentious and deeply felt here; as a result <strong>this is music to be immersed into, not be followed rationally</strong>. It lacks a tight structure, its boundaries are obscure, and it is extremely hard to isolate specific parts â€“ even more so to remember them after listening.</p>

<p>Graced with an amazing cover (crying out for a tape release) by the Russian <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nethertemple616/" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-400">Morkh</a>, somewhat reminiscent in style of <strong>David Herrerias</strong>â€™ work for <a href="https://www.metal-archives.com/images/5/0/5/9/505997.jpg?1909" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-400">Akhlys</a> and <a href="https://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Nightbringer/Ego_Dominus_Tuus/443490" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-400">Nightbringer</a>, A Nocturnal Emanation is a release with somnambulistic themes, grand sweeping atmospheres, <strong>a gnarled expedition into nocturnal mysteries</strong>. Worthy of the name of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zalmoxis" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-400">a shamanic divinity of ancient Balkans</a>, the band here fits well the theme of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_D._Chumbley" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-400">Andrew Chumbley</a>â€™s Hypnagogia: <strong>the meeting place of sleeping, dreaming and waking</strong>.<br />
