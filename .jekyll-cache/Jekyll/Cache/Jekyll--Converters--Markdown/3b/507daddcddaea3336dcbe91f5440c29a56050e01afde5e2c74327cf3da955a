I"ð<p>This is the third incarnation of a blog in which I try to dabble into all things uncanny. Mostly reviews of music albums, books, movies and games (both digital and pen &amp; paper); as well as musings on folklore, mythology and the occult; and a few short stories of mine. Most of the recent material is in English, while the majority of the older material (as well as most of the short stories) are in Greek.<br />
<br />
The blog does not actively accept comissions about reviews.<br /></p>
