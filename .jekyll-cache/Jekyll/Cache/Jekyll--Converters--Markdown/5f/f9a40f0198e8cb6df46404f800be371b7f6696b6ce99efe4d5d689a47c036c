I"(<p>The fact that Shatraug is a workaholic of disturbing proportions is more or less well known . The guitarist/mastermind of Sargeist currently participates in at least 14(!) active bands. Due to this hotpot of activity, Sargeist were put in a sort of hiatus after the amazing 2010 “Let the Devil in” album, not taking into account a split and an ep released in 2011. Last year the band unleashed a compilation of rarities/b-sides, and this year the time came for the release of their 4th full length album, “Feeding the Crawling Shadows”.</p>
