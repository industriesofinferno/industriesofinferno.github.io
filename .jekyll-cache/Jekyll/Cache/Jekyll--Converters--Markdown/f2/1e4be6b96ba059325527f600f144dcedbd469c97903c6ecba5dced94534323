I"f<p class="indentia">Since its inception, black metal has been on a quest for the otherworldly, striving to shed as many traces of the contemporary world as possible, it being a genre deeply in war with (and in fear of) everyday routine, the mundane, and the spectre of dominant society. This is embedded in the extremity of both music and aesthetics. What could be expected is the step beyond distorted vocals; namely the complete discarding of voice due to its central role in human experience. Yet, there are few instrumental black metal albums, none of which has really moved beyond negligible recognition.</p>
