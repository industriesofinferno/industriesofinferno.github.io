I"ò<p class="indentia">A story is the projection of an experience on and through a communication medium of artistic nature; the experience being either real or imaginary, but either way experienced (in the past or at present) by the storyteller. It is the projection ON a communication medium because the experience is formalised on the canvas chosen by the storyteller, be it oral narration (in which case the canvas is the voice and gestural ‚Äúlibrary‚Äù), literature (empty writing space being the canvas), theatre (canvas: the scene and its unchangeable architecture), etc. It is a projection THROUGH a medium because the story‚Äôs content is presented via techniques and materials embedded on the medium (oral narration: words, sentences, voice pitch, body movement(though it blurs the bounds between oral narration and theatrics). Literature: words, sentences, literary structure (paragraphs, hyphenation, chapters), accompanying imagery. Theatre: costumes, stage props and decoration, actors (blending the lines between theatre and narration), lighting, any templates concerning audience placement or participation, script, play advertisement and press presentation.</p>
