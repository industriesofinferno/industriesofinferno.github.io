I"<p class="indentia">There are multiple ways to sort through the members of a given category, each essentially as arbitrary as the next one. In the case of the planets of the solar system, the default model nowadays arranges them in order of distance from the sun, from nearest to furthest. Despite its logic (going from the center outwards), it is not faultless (if we include Pluto in the schema, Neptuneâ€™s orbit makes this outermost of the giants the furthest planet for 20 years each two and a half centuries) or panacea. For instance, this arrangement is of little practical value to the terrestrial observer looking for a model that can practically  resonate with her own experience. Alternative ways of sorting could be by apparent brightness, time of emergence on the local horizon, color, occult properties, or any other characteristic that may be of acute and immediate interest.</p>
