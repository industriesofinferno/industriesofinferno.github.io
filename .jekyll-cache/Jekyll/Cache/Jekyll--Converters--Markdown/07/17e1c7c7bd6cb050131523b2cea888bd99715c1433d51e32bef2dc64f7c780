I"¬<p class="indentia">Once more I turn to the Dutch black metal scene. Last year its offerings were top notch. This yearâ€™s â€œDe Oogstâ€ep (by Uitzichtloos) is pretty good, Pyriphlegethonâ€™s debut is out and waiting, while Kjeldâ€˜s first full-length, â€œSkymâ€, drew my attention past week. When I found out about this band, I didnâ€™t check its country of origin; due to its name, the cover of the album, and most importantly due to its music, I considered Kjeld a Norwegian or Swedish band. It is a fact that those Dutch are building upon the corpus of second wave Norwegian black metal, using the tools of this black metal sub-genre exclusively. Although they flirt with imitation syndromes, it would be unfair to label them as another Â«blind-worshipÂ» band.</p>

<p class="indentia">First things first: â€œSkymâ€ reveals 3 band members with very good chemistry, the kind of which is usually forged after years of bonding. The fact that this is the bandâ€™s debut (with only a 2010 demo adding up to their discography) is quite striking. But the truth is that the 3 members also participate together in other bands, thus explaining their quite tight musical bond.</p>

<p class="indentia">Stepping onto the music part: â€œSkymâ€ is a work of art paying (conscious or unconscious â€“ doesnâ€™t really matter) tribute to the high ends of â€œNorsk Svart Metallâ€, and especially to the naturalistic tendencies within it. Here lie Kampfarâ€™s mountain soul, Gehennaâ€™s majestic march, and (first 2 albumsâ€™) Gorgorothâ€™s wandering ritual. Riff-wise, the band crafts with elegance and diversity, alas imbuing their palette with some (few to be honest) groovy moments which are reminiscent of some 00â€™s less-than-interesting Scandinavian bands (late Taake period for one). Still, the composition nucleus ticks fine, almost never relinquishing its hold on the listenerâ€™s interest. Attention: The composition style is not ground breaking, nor does it reek with originality, but nevertheless it manages to convey a glimpse into the 90â€™s. The fact that the album is not over-produced is a considerable factor to its effectiveness.</p>

<p class="indentia">â€œSkymâ€ is quite addictive to those of us that feel most at ease with the â€œgood old black metalâ€ part of our collection. It shines due to its staying close to the core of the 90â€™s sound, yet never blatantly mimicking its idols of worship. An overtly enjoyable album, â€œSkymâ€ reminded me of Tsjuderâ€™s â€œDesert Northern Hellâ€ as far as the appearance of similar feelings after hearing it is concerned. Finally: Exquisite album cover, primitive and impressionistic, close to Kittelsenâ€™s spirit.</p>
