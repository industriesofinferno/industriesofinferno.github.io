I"8<p>This post revolves around a new monster based mainly on Siberian pregnancy/birth folklore. The creature is used as the base material for painting with (very) broad brushstrokes a rough setting with taiga and steppe elements. A couple of tables are thrown in, along with three unusual items (a table with magical coins connected to one of the possible spirit habitations is bound to appear in the immediate future).</p>

<p>As far as the raw materials are concerned, they are the following four beliefs of indigenous Siberian people, all extracted from <a href="https://archive.org/details/aboriginalsiberi00czap/page/n6" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-400">Aboriginal Siberia</a>:<br />
