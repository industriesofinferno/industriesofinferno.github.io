<p><strong>20. Y â€“ De Occulta Philosophia</strong><br />

<p><br />
Somewhere between noise and harsh black metal with an all-consuming occult feeling, one and a half hour of wanderings in dungeon corridors. Including some of the most diverse and interesting vocals that one can hear today. The intelligence behind This Is Past delivers an onslaught of mysticism. Bonus Track: this radio show, which is one of the most imposing and atmospheric things that I have heard.<br />
<br /></p>

<p><strong>19. Arcturus â€“ Arcturian</strong><br />
<br /></p>

<p><br />
I had long waited for this album, namely a worthy successor to â€œThe Sham Mirrorsâ€ (â€œSideshow Symphoniesâ€ didnâ€™t quite convince me). Sverd&amp;co return to the glories of days past, creating an album that sounds refreshing, showcasing a band tightly bonded. ICS Vortexâ€™s performance is magnificent, reminiscent of Garmâ€™s glory days. One of the most flowing and catchy albums of this year.

<p><strong>18. Batushka â€“ Litourgyia</strong><br />

<p><br />
An album that came out of nowhere at the yearâ€™s end, exhibiting an orthodox painting in its cover, teasing us with the membersâ€™ supposed identities, and hyping very quickly. The thing is, that â€œLitourgyiaâ€ lives up to most of the hype; it sports amazing monastic/psalm-like vocals, is permeated with a deeply devout atmosphere, and riff-wise the things are getting more interesting with each successive listening session.<br />
<br /></p>

<p><strong>17. Death Karma â€“ The History Of Death &amp; Burial Rituals part I</strong><br />
<br /></p>
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2142430865/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless=""><a href="http://ironboneheadproductions.bandcamp.com/album/death-karma-the-history-of-death-burial-rituals-part-i">Death Karma - The History Of Death &amp; Burial Rituals part I by Iron Bonehead Productions</a></iframe>
<p><br />
The magic of Cult Of Fire resides within this project of 2 of the Czech masters. Highly varied black metal, which roams through six countries, gazing upon the (pre-)burial rituals of each with a different sonic lens, always within the genre territory. An album that sees face to face with Cult Of Fireâ€™s latest opus, and proves (along with this yearâ€™s Malokarpatan album) that Central/Eastern Europe is a matrix of ingenious extreme metal.

<p><strong>16. Awe â€“ Providentia</strong><br />

<p><br />
One of the most non-conformist albums of 2015, â€œProvidentiaâ€ moves beyond the boundaries of orthodox black metal per se, implementing a bucketload of guitar ideas, which make the careful listener return again and again in this multi-layered masterpiece. It certainly takes a lot of courage to immerse oneself in the complexity of the album, but the result is certainly rewarding.

<p><strong>15. Black Cilice â€“ Mysteries</strong><br />
<br /></p>

<p>This Portuguese black metal band has been very active for the last 6 years, but it was only with this yearâ€™s â€œMysteriesâ€ that they got in my radar. Raw (more production- than compositionally- wise) black metal with an almost ritualistic core, that nevertheless includes some of the most fulfilling of this yearâ€™s riffs. A work of art to be listened to in dark isolation, an ode to the spirit of true black metal.<br />
<br /></p>

<p><strong>14. MÃ»spellzheimr â€“ Hyldest Til Trolddommens Flamme</strong><br />
<br /></p>
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3215693691/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless=""><a href="http://lunarapparitions.bandcamp.com/album/hyldest-til-trolddommens-flamme-demo-compilation">Hyldest til Trolddommens Flamme / Demo Compilation by MÃºspellzheimr</a></iframe>
<p><br />
If you are asking for the best traditional (in the strict â€™90s sense) black metal album of 2015 search no more. The Danish have crafted an album that gazes steadily upon the frosty darkness of the Scandinavian scene of days past, and has the glamour of such grand artists as Kampfar, Setherial, and first-album Dimmu Borgir and Borknagar. Most people seem to have fallen for Slaegt this year, but for me there is no doubt about the best Danish black metal act.<br />
<br /></p>

<p><strong>13. False â€“ Untitled</strong><br />
<br /></p>
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2205631650/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless=""><a href="http://gileadmedia.bandcamp.com/album/untitled-2015">Untitled (2015) by False</a></iframe>
<p><br />
Gilead Media has nailed two brilliant albums this year, the first being Falseâ€™s debut, â€œUntitledâ€. Black metal steeped in both American and European tradition, drawing just a bit from the cascadian scene, creating a study in negativity and the archaic. Graced with brilliant compositions and more than satisfactory vocals from Rachel, â€œUntitledâ€ is an album to return to, again and again.<br />
<br /></p>

<p><strong>12. HÃ¦then â€“ Shaped by Aeolian Winds</strong><br />
<br /></p>
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1783762945/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless=""><a href="http://haethen.bandcamp.com/album/shaped-by-aeolian-winds">Shaped By Aeolian Winds by HÃ¦then</a></iframe>
<p><br />
Firstly, this album has the best cover art of 2015 by far. Secondly, HÃ¦thenâ€˜s debut album is an atmospheric ode to nature and the past, filtered through the prism of early Enslaved and Emperor, as well as Wolves In The Throne Room. Deeply pagan throughout, with a hint of eeriness production-wise, â€œShaped by Aeolian Windsâ€ is the definite winter album of the list.

<p><strong>11. Pale Chalice â€“ Negate the Infinite &amp; Miraculous</strong><br />
<br /></p>

<p><br />
The second album of Gilead Media in the list, Pale Chaliceâ€™s debut is not so far from Falseâ€™s sound, though it is more deeply rooted in the European scene. Highly agile guitars, which do not shy from melodic outbreaks, and some of the most suggestive song titles of 2015, like â€œFragile Bones Cradling Tallow â€. What shines above all however is its passionate, occult atmosphere; a nocturnal album that pleads for solitary listenings.

<p><strong>10. Enforcer â€“ From Beyond</strong><br />
<br /></p>
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=15980105/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless=""><a href="http://enforcer.bandcamp.com/album/from-beyond">From Beyond by Enforcer</a></iframe>
<p><br />
Itâ€™s almost impossible to skip an Enforcer release on a year list. With their fourth album the Swedes keep delivering excellent heavy metal, whose caliber is on par with the grand â€™80s monsters. A bit more introspective than their previous works (take for instance the magnificent â€œBelow The Slumberâ€), it nevertheless has all the trademarks of this amazing band that we are privileged to experience in out time.<br />
<br /></p>

<p><strong>9. Crypt Sermon â€“ Out of the Garden</strong><br />
<br /></p>
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2976892666/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless=""><a href="http://darkdescentrecords.bandcamp.com/album/out-of-the-garden">Out of the Garden by Crypt Sermon</a></iframe>
<p><br />
Just listen to â€œInto The Holy Of Holiesâ€. â€œOut Of The Gardenâ€ is epic doom metal done right, and simultaneously managing not sound like another Candlemass/Solitude Aeturnus clone. Riffs here are plain majesty. It is quite a rare thing the existence of a doom album in my end year top list, yet Crypt Sermon was nailed there since this album came out.<br />
<br /></p>

<p><strong>8. MisÃ¾yrming â€“ SÃ¶ngvar elds og Ã³reiÃ°u</strong><br />
<br /></p>
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2158092846/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless=""><a href="http://misthyrming.bandcamp.com/album/s-ngvar-elds-og-rei-u">SÃ¶ngvar elds og Ã³reiÃ°u by MisÃ¾yrming</a></iframe>
<p><br />
Noxious, maelstromic black metal, which draws upon the darkest side of the orthodox genre (Svartidaudi, Numinous), and wanders through subterranean passages with majestic skill. Top-notch riffing, suffocating atmosphere, and vocals full of command; the necrotic spirit of black metal breathes mightily in here. Another masterpiece from Iceland, following on the tradition of Wormlust, Sinmara and Svartidaudi.<br />
<br /></p>

<p><strong>7. DÃ¸dheimsgard â€“ A Umbra Omega</strong><br />
<br /></p>
<iframe class="w-full" height="415" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aCFEETZX3SY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p><br />
Well, a new DÃ¸dheimsgard after 8 years is definitely cause for celebration, especially since it is so much better than its predecessor, fighting toe to toe with â€œ666 Internationalâ€ (as far as I am concerned) in quality terms. We had missed Vicotnikâ€™s ingenious riffs, doubly so their being accompanied by Aldrahnâ€™s voice. The storm of ideas that coexist in this one is threatening to the listenerâ€™s sanity (and a bit to the albumâ€™s cohesion to be honest).

<p><strong>6. Terminus â€“ The Reaperâ€™s Spiral</strong><br />
<br /></p>

<p><br />
Good old epic heavy metal. Whoever had heard the â€œInto Exileâ€ demo (whose four tracks are part of the album) was on the lookout, with the uttermost attention for this debut. Not much to say here, Terminus are the last link on a long chain that contains bands such as Lord Weird Slough Feg, Isen Torr, Borrowed Time, etc. Pure epicness deserves pure praise.<br />
<br /></p>

<p><br />
I recently reviewed this album, and I stand by my opinion, that if this album was released somewhere in the late â€™90s it would be considered a classic. Black metal with a folk soul, with guitar parts that are begging to be listened to again and again. This yearâ€™s shining jewel and example of the Swedish underground sceneâ€™s blazing quality.

<p><strong>4. Volahn/Arizmenda/Kallathon/Shataan â€“ Desert Dances and Serpent Sermons</strong><br />

<p><br />
It is indeed rare the year in which a Crepusculo Negro release is not part of my list. There was not a full album from any of its bands in 2015, but this 4-way split more than made up for it. A tour of the desert, the jungles, and the dungeons (in Arizmendaâ€™s case) of Central America, this is like a fist of devotion raised towards the indigenous gods of the continent.

<p><strong>3. Nocternity â€“ Harps of the Ancient Temples</strong><br />
<br /></p>
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2534850680/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless=""><a href="http://ironboneheadproductions.bandcamp.com/album/nocternity-harps-of-the-ancient-temples">Nocternity - Harps Of The Ancient Temples by Iron Bonehead Productions</a></iframe>
<p><br />
Taking a different approach, more hypnotic and subdued (not in a bad way), without moments of elation, â€œHarps of the Ancient Templesâ€ showcases a band that has matured in an elegant way. Mesmerizing mid-tempo black metal of refreshing clarity and originality. If one searches for influences, he may well stumble into the middle tracks of â€œHvis Lysset Tar Ossâ€ and the gloomiest parts of â€œFilosofemâ€, as well as the more shadowy parts of â€œThornsâ€, all filtered through Khal Drogoâ€™s personal mark. Minimalistic in many ways, Nocternityâ€™s new opus is an album that breezes, not blasts, its path through the listener without much effort, without climaxes, and ends up winning you all the way.<br />
<br /></p>

<p><strong>2. Trial â€“ Vessel</strong><br />
<br /></p>
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2527641307/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless=""><a href="http://hcrtrial.bandcamp.com/album/vessel">Vessel by Trial</a></iframe>
<p><br />
Canâ€™t really say much about this masterpiece. Maybe the best example, in recent years, of â€™80s heavy metal revival, focusing on US power, classic British metal, and Mercyful Fate guitars, this is just amazing. Each of these songs is an artifact to be treasured and exhibited next to the Classics.<br />
<br /></p>
