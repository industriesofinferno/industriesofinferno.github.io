I"Þ<p>It is said that the man who makes the crossing of river Volga by himself during early spring, will be granted a hearing with his bocknovoi. That is, if he survives the fords of the Great River. For it is at this time that the snows of lower Caucasus melt, and the streams and the rivers rage with the power of the spiteful winter departure. The flower seeds still bide their time inside the soil, wise in their hesitation. But the Vindiy, the local Alan witches, cross the bald meadows, in search of ingredients: mandrake roots from the execution sites, nichtervii from the wake of Velesâ€™ steps, kaskevin from the nests of water nymphs. It is a strange time of the year for simple folk who wander without purpose or company.</p>
