I"¥*<p>Arckanum â€“ Den FÃ¶rstfÃ¶dde</p>

<p>Shamaataeâ€™s swansong is a strange beast with quite unconventional song structures â€“ several seem like weird elongated intros or snapshots from a paranoid film. Yet, thatâ€™s the magic of this album â€“ it offers something different, yet remaining throughout an Arckanum album. An excellent farewell.</p>

<p>Attic â€“ Sanctimonious</p>

<p>It sounds like Kind Diamond, vocally, musically and lyrically. To be exact it sounds like good King Diamond â€“ and the few blasting parts they incorporate work just fine. Anything that sounds like good King Diamond is bound to end up in my list.</p>

<p>Cradle Of Filth â€“ Cryptoriana â€“ The Seductiveness Of Decay</p>

<p>I grew up with Cradle Of Filth, I loved Cradle up to Midian, and with Cryptoriana they pulled me back in their wagon. Yes itâ€™s a safe album steeped in nostalgia for the first four albums, but that is what I ask from 2017 Dani. The fact that it contains one of the best songs of their career (The Night At Catafalque Manor) is just the icing on the cake. [Full review in Greek here]</p>

<p>De Magia Veterum â€“ Naked Swords Into The Wombs Of The Enemy</p>

<p>Maurice is one of the most hyper-productive members of the scene, and De Magia Veterum is his best project for 2017. In Naked Swords lie 30 minutes of hyper-tense black metal with a mesmerizing and completely personal guitar sound. The atmosphere of extreme damnation.</p>

<p>Divine Element â€“ Thaurachs Of Borsu</p>

<p>Contemporary epic death metal is a term that automatically repels me. Divine Element somehow manage to become the exception to this, with their spontaneous feeling that combines technical and highly interesting guitars with a bombastic element. The album even winks to Basil Poledouris, what is not to love? [Full review in Greek here]</p>

<p>Fleurety â€“ The White Death</p>

<p>18 years after Min Tid Skal Komme Fleurety returned with a bizarre, seemingly disjointed album â€“ yet somehow the result is very very good. A partial return to the black metal sound of yore, a song-writing skill that hasnâ€™t been blunted by time, this is almost educational, in a dynamic way. [Full review in Greek here]</p>

<p>Horisont â€“ About Time</p>

<p>Amazing hard rock, a tour-de-force of the â€˜70s with a slightly radio friendly attitude and a huge ability of writing timeless hymns like â€œElectricalâ€ and the self-titled. This is the stuff that used to fill arena stadiums. The bastard child of Scorpions, Uriah Heep, Rainbow, and a host of others.</p>

<p>â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”-</p>

<p>Jordablod â€“ Upon my Cremation Pyre</p>

<p>Somehow this reminded me of old Enslaved jamming with Hawkwind. It definitely has a strong aura of improvisation that brings Vikinglir into mind. A quite exotic nordic listen that flows almost seamlessly â€“ the overall duration could be a bit shortened, but thatâ€™s why future discography exists.</p>

<p>Krallice â€“ Go Be Forgotten</p>

<p>I am not a big fan of Krallice. Still, their second 2017 album just clicked. Maybe due to the B&amp;W cover, maybe due to the non-abstract title, mainly due to the absence of sophistication. This is Kralliceâ€™s best work, a tight black metal album which does not scoff at its genre â€“ and it shiones because of it.</p>

<p>â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”-</p>

<p>Malokarpatan â€“ Nordkarpatenland</p>

<p>Pagan rituals in Slovakian countryside, filtered through an â€˜80s proto extreme metal lens. Malokarpatan improved hugely since the debut, and here they present us with speed metal/first wave of black metal anthems. All this under an amazing cover art. [Full review in Greek here]</p>

<p>One Master â€“ Lycanthropic Burrowing</p>

<p>Extreme, oh so extreme black metal, flirting with noise structures, dominated by a mania that is lycanthropic indeed. Black metal at its most ferocious which thankfully never forgets the riffs in favour of abstract destruction. Music to howl to the moon.</p>

<p>â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”-</p>

<p>Profundum â€“ Come, Holy Death</p>

<p>This is how storming through cloudways and angel flesh sounds like â€“ you canâ€™t get smoother than that. This is the distillation of atmospheric black metal and celestial wings, a canvas on which to float eternally. The compositions are not the main focus (though they are pretty good) here; it is the sound that steals the lightning.</p>

<p>â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”-</p>

<p>Satyricon â€“ Deep Calleth Upon Deep</p>

<p>Another band that returned after many many years with an album worthy of their past. I stopped listening to Satyricon after Volcano, and this is their first album since then that I listened to more than once â€“ many times to be precise. Finally they got the song-writing right and they managed to successfully mix present with past.</p>

<p>Wrathblade â€“ God of the Deep Unleashed</p>

<p>Rough-around-the-edges, barbaric epic metal. Where Lunar Shadow are the Nobles in this list, Wrathblade are the Savages. Galloping riffs (thereâ€™s been done some great work at the guitar department), unpolished vocals which call to battle, Brocas Helm and Slough Feg by their side.</p>

<p>â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”-</p>

<p>Yellow Eyes â€“ Immersion Trench Reverie</p>

<p>I have a soft spot for these New Yorkers though their previous album was something of a letdown. Thankfully, Yellow Eyes are back with a blizzard of intelligent traditional black metal with a heart of dark folk. Alpine New York, thatâ€™s how you sound. [Full review in Greek here]
The Top 10</p>

<ol>
  <li>Lunar Shadow â€“ Far From Light</li>
</ol>

<p>This is the epic metal of the year. Lyricism, history, amazing-amazing guitars which bring to mind epic power metalâ€™s golden era. This is overflowing with epic and romantic emotion, and brings back to mind my early Blind Guardian listens back in the â€˜90s, along with AD&amp;D modules reading. [Full review in Greek here]</p>

<ol>
  <li>Chelsea Wolfe â€“ Hiss Spun</li>
</ol>

<p>This is the sonicalization of neuroses into voices both ethereal and full of terror, into waves of metallic noise; a bleak, black landscape in which you can immerse yourself, and let it embrace you like an uterus. This is the sound of impending doom. [Full review in Greek here]</p>

<ol>
  <li>Evilfeast â€“ Elegies of the Stellar Wind</li>
</ol>

<p>There was a time that black metal was only snow, night, forests and stars, as far as I was concerned. This is Evilfeastâ€™s black metal, and I couldnâ€™t be happier listening to it. This is atmospheric black metal as it should be, returning me to this younger state of spirit.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Resurgency â€“ No Worldsâ€¦ nor Gods Beyond</li>
</ol>

<p>The brutal death metal album of the year as far as I am concerned. Coming out of nowhere, this riff-fest of an album worships Morbid Angel and Deicide, managing to stir completely clear of any filler compositions.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Urarv â€“ Aurum</li>
</ol>

<p>Aldrahn returns once more with a new project, this one dressed in spectacular vestments, treading many music fields, from black metal to avant-garde. His voice, as voluptuous as always, here sings, moans, growls, whistles, and reconfirms that Aldrahnian Norwegian is a pure addiction of a language.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Locust Leaves â€“ A Subtler Kind Of Light</li>
</ol>

<p>A Subtler Kind Of Light is a cryptic creation deeply rooted and devoted to heavy metal, yet an enemy of metalâ€™s rigidity. Here lies everything from black/thrash to Watchtower-like prog. The album reeks of angles and hidden nooks, which turn it into a plateau whose complete exploration requires devotion. [Full review in Greek here]</p>

<ol>
  <li>Necromante â€“ The Magickal Presence of Occult Forces</li>
</ol>

<p>These Brazilians drank deep from the Sarcofago and Necromantia wellsprings, creating an album that writhes with ritualistic volcanic energy. Combined with the delicious vocal mis-pronunciation of English, this is a homage to very early black metal. Music to lift your fist in the face of god.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Acrimonious â€“ Eleven Dragons</li>
</ol>

<p>Eleven Dragons rearranges the chips of extreme metal in familiar yet Highly imaginative patterns. It allows an emotional immersion within it, without raising any pretentiousness walls, engulfing and easily freezing the listenerâ€™s blood. This is what apex 2017 black metal sounds like. [Full review in Greek here]</p>

<ol>
  <li>Black Cilice â€“ Banished from Time</li>
</ol>

<p>This is spectral lo-fi music, the closer thing to spirit whispers and haunted passages. This is the furthest one can get from humanity. It feels like wandering in medieval dungeons and upon the paths of the deceased, outside time. Les Legions Noires would be proud.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Wolves In The Throne Room â€“ Thrice Woven</li>
</ol>

<p>Thrice Woven made me experience again this magickal feeling that overwhelmed me when in days long past I listened to albums such as Emperorâ€™s In The Nightside Eclipse: it bade me strap on my headphones and go out in the dark autumn night to gaze at the firmament. Black metal at its most majestic. [Full review in Greek here]</p>
