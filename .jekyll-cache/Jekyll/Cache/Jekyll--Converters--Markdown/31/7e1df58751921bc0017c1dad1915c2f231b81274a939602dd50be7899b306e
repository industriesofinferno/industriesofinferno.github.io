I"¡<p class="indentia"><strong>Anticipation is not a static thing</strong>; it changes forms, adapting to cultural and historical conditions. <strong>Contemporary anticipation</strong> largely consists of <strong>digital traces and mechanisms</strong>: checking inboxes, blogs, and download sites, participating in social media conversations and hypotheses, occasionally with the artists themselves. <strong>Back in the â€˜90s and early â€˜00s</strong> the quest for information and conjecture was more <strong>isolated</strong> and <strong>passive</strong>, and also had a more <strong>physical mien</strong>: visitations of record shops and press outlets, the careful distillation of magazine pages and silent contemplation. That doesnâ€™t mean that anticipation has lost any of its enchantment, only that it has been transmuted to a different beast altogether. It is rather difficult to fully experience the anticipation of yore nowadays (which those of us that lived it sometimes tend to idealize), unless someone is willing to go completely ascetic, eschewing the internet. Still, <strong>there are occasions where the shade of past anticipation can be somewhat evoked</strong>.</p>
