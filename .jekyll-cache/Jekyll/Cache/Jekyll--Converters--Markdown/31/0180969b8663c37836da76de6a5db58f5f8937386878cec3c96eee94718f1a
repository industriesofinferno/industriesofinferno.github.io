I"£<p class="indentia">Letâ€™s start with a contemporary legend: It is rumored, not in the least by Mr. Doctor himself, that the Devil Dollâ€™s first album was not â€œThe Girl Who Wasâ€¦ Deathâ€, but â€œThe Mark Of The Beastâ€, a record of which only one copy was pressed, and which copy is owned by Mr. Doctor. According to his own words, Â«This is a painting, not a graphic workÂ» (see how the ontological quality of the work of art changes according to its singularity, in the mind of the creator â€“ or the audience. I ask, however, is it a â€œpaintingâ€ indeed, or just a copy of one, since the performance that was recorded in this copy is a particular event in time, and what in fact exists in that copy is just a representation of this performance?) This is the first but not the only such example. Wu-Tang Clan recorded the â€œOnce Upon A Time In Shaolinâ€¦â€ album in 2014, which was again pressed in just one copy.</p>
