I"™<p>Dark Descent Records keeps unearthing lumps of pure gold, as far as their 2014 releases are concerned. Following the amazing debut album of Thantifaxath, here comes now a Belgian act, Emptiness, to grab the black torch. Featuring 2 members of Enthroned, and Pro-Pain drummer, Jonas Sanders, Â«Nothing but the WholeÂ» is the bandâ€™s 4th full-length album. I find myself regretful of not having discovered them before this release. It entered my radar on early June, carried on a locomotive of recommendations.The first spin was all it took to make my reservedness vaporize, and since then the release holds one the top places in my best-of-2014-so-far list.</p>
