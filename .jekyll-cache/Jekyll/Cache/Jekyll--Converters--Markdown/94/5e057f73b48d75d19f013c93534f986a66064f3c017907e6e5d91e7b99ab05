I"@<p>This is the third incarnation of a blog in which I try to dabble into all things uncanny. Mostly reviews of music albums, books, movies and video games; as well as musings on folklore, mythology and the occult; and a few short stories of mine.<br />
Most of the more recent material is in English, while most of the older (as well as most short stories) are in Greek. The blog does not actively accept comissions about reviews.<br />
