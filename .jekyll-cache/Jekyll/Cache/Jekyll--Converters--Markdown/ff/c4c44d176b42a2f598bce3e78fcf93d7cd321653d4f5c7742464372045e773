I"<p class="indentia">I am of a mixed mind on the detective short story format. On one hand it offers a setting and characters that are (in theory, at least) enriched and expanded through each successive narrative, enabling the reader to develop an intimate relationship with the writer’s cosmos. On the other hand, the genre leans towards repetition: rigid patterns of investigation emerge and crystallize, leading to a procession of repetitive and predictable mannerisms<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. Moreover, the detective archetype reeks with the spirit of modernity, idealizing personality aspects and attitudes like cold rationality, suppression of emotion, and mind over matter, as well as de-contextualising crime and normalizing societal law-enforced norms.</p>

      <p>This is of course not necessarily a bad thing – there is much to be enjoyed in the reading of a predictable well-written story with a setting and characters that you are intimate with, for it blends the merits of rereading with the freshness of new strokes over a familiar canvas. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
