I"Å<p class="indentia">Besides the genreâ€™s name, there are albums of the black metal variety, that are not prone to being transmitters of utter-darkness soundscapes. Even some of the 90s mastersâ€™ albums are testimonies of this; for in albums such as â€œBattles In The Northâ€ or â€œFrostâ€ darkness is a distant second entity being evoked, majestic frigidness being by far more dominant. The cold, unforgiving yet filled with unparalleled majesty side of Nature is an essential part of the black metal multifaceted entity. That is where lie the banners of Greeceâ€™s Isolert, a band that firstly appeared roughly a year before, with the â€œIsolated Soulâ€ demo. Reviewing that short release  I had concluded that â€œit is a somewhat rushed release, that nevertheless creates promises about the future.â€ Luckily, it seems that these promises are more or less fulfilled with the bandâ€™s debut album, â€œNo Hope, No Lightâ€¦Only Death,â€ released earlier in 2016.</p>

<p class="indentia">What becomes apparent from almost the beginning is that Isolert have a thing for melody, mainly of the icy quality, not unlike that of the mid-/late-90s Swedish scene. But, as it was also the case in â€œIsolated Soulâ€ the Scandinavian influence is filtered through a Greek prism; what comes to mind is Naer Mataronâ€™s first period â€“ a fine tutor, to say the least. Guitars make long-winded appearances, zealously emphasizing the atmospheric parts of most riffs â€“ passion is a thing to be reckoned in here. A passion, traces of which can also be found in the definitely improved (in comparison to the demo) vocals, which traverse the spectrum demarcated by the growling core hues and the clean, almost epic clamours and narration. Yet, despite all the melody talk, the band also knows how to incorporate some thrashy and hyperblasting inferno in their music. Structure-wise things are not overly complex, yet this simplicity is quite effective from an atmospheric point of view. Speed varies, from mid-tempo clarity to blastbeat exaltation. The production is typical for this kind of sound, grim and clear â€“ nothing spectacular.</p>

<p class="indentia">Isolert kicks off its formal discography with a very good album, steeped in the genreâ€™s tradition. It may have a few shortcomings â€“ namely lack of innovation (if such things are of concern in black metal) and some variance in the composition quality department â€“ yet it is a much too enjoyable (and even nostalgic) an album to be shadowed by them. The band sports a much more polished and well-structured facade in comparison to their last year demo, bringing into fruition the past promises.</p>
