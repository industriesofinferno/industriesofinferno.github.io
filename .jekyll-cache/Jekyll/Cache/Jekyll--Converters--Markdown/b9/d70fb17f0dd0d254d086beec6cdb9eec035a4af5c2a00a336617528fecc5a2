I"∫<p class="indentia">Experimental black metal. That is how the band‚Äôs music is described in Encyclopaedia Metallum. Experimental black metal is an almost hilarious umbrella term, under whose cover can be found things as diverse as Jute Gyte‚Äôs microtonal exercises, Nachtmystium‚Äôs melodic/psychedelic popular tunes and The Axis Of Perdition‚Äôs hellish industrial landscapes. It is a box to stuff all things that do not fit to one‚Äôs imaginative model of traditional black metal structure, or just a shelf in which to put things that are a bit hard to compartmentalize under other subgenres. Anyway, it means almost nothing, apart from it being a tool for hazy communication. The band itself just claims that ‚Äúwe sound like molotov cocktails. Your cliff‚Äôs edge is nearing, and we stand on the other side of the gorge, playing our music‚Äù on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/slutetslutetslutet" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-400">its Soundcloud</a>, and I find its words resounding far closer to the point. (You can also check <a href="http://theendcommune.blogspot.com/" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-400">this blog</a>, run by the band‚Äôs members ).</p>

<p class="indentia">This compilation includes parts of the band‚Äôs ultra-limited previous three demos (which apparently were available only to persons that sent personal libations to the band ‚Äì blood, hair, etc), while being itself quite limited (33 copies on Teratology Sound &amp; Vision and 100 on Psychedelic Lotus Order Records), and is graced with a cover art that would not seem amiss in an <a href="https://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Aksumite/Prideless_Lions/344494" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-400">early Aksumite demo</a>.</p>

<p class="indentia">What lies in the album‚Äôs 53 minutes is varied in content, but definitely characterized by a rehearsal-like quality, compositionally-wise (the sound is pretty good). After the introductory news clip (from the 9/11 attacks) two things keep resurfacing throughout the album: a semi-punk attitude that was recognizable in Lifelover, and also hints of post punk, especially in vocals, which, apart from the last track, keep reminding of a more edgy Rozz Williams, while being also quite out of tune, yet quite congenial to the music. Simple riffs are repeated throughout by a single guitar crafting a crude yet obsessive atmosphere, like a shamanistic trance. The guitar sound, along with some of the most desperate howls, are somewhat related to Denmark‚Äôs Slaegt, and by extension Burzum‚Äôs debut. Moreover, there are species of melody dwelling in here, them also being crude and beautiful on the same time. Structure-wise things are in flux; themes change abruptly inside the long-winded songs, like each one is a mega structure consisting of two or more separate entities.</p>

<p class="indentia">The album‚Äôs peak is most probably the 22-minute long, improvisational last track ‚ÄúO Ziemia! A Vision In Two Parts,‚Äù which, though sporting several disjunct parts, builds up as a dream-like monument to the cover‚Äôs winged entity. Vocals in here are reminiscent of a magic ritual, both as commands and pleas to entities, as well as a distressing narrative. Distorted guitar parts, almost inaudible, partner up with a sax-like haze and a prominent bass. The improvisation runs down even to the song‚Äôs lyrics, which, allegedly were improvised upon recording.</p>

<p class="indentia">A seemingly non-cohesive splatter of ideas all wrapped up in a skin of paranoid crudeness, this compilation reveals a band that very simplistically creates music aphorisms of the irrational. Aphorisms that are maybe lacking in grandeur but more than make up for it in the way that it manages to absorb the listener in a ritual-like fashion. And more than that, this album escalates in degrees of addiction pretty fast, perhaps due to the fact that this simplicity keeps revealing small new aspects in every listen.</p>
