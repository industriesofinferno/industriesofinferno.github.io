I"m<p class="indentia">Let’s start with a contemporary legend: It is rumored, not in the least by <a href="http://www.devildoll.nl/article6.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-400">Mr. Doctor himself</a>, that the Devil Doll’s first album was not “The Girl Who Was… Death”, but “The Mark Of The Beast”, a record of which only one copy was pressed, and which copy is owned by Mr. Doctor. According to his own words, «This is a painting, not a graphic work» (see how the ontological quality of the work of art changes according to its singularity, in the mind of the creator – or the audience. I ask, however, is it a “painting” indeed, or just a copy of one, since the performance that was recorded in this copy is a particular event in time, and what in fact exists in that copy is just a representation of this performance?) This is the first but not the only such example. Wu-Tang Clan recorded the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Once_Upon_a_Time_in_Shaolin" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-400">Once Upon A Time In Shaolin…</a> album in 2014, which was again pressed in just one copy.</p>
