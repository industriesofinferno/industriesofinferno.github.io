I"*<p class="indentia"><em>A hamlet that lies at the furthest edge of civilization, somewhere in Estonia, living in a mythical age. History intrudes in the guise of an uncanny German baron and his moon-stricken daughter (German aristocracy was the norm for a large period of time in the area) who visit their manor in the village. A local boy falls in love with the baroness; he becomes obsessed and visits her room at night, watching her sleepwalk on the roof. A local girl who has been in love with the boy for some time, tries to win his heart.</em></p>
