I"_<p class="indentia">There may be no moment more glorious in black metal than when the underground shines with blazing inspiration. Panphage, a one-man band from Sweden, was a completely unknown to me entity before this summer, when I was introduced by a friend to their “Ursvöl” demo, a raw exemplar of 90’s Scandinavian black metal riffing with a pinch of folk embedded in guitar-parts structure, ending up as a beautiful descendant of the pagan spirit of the once-mighty Norwegian scene. This year’s “Storm” is the debut album of the band, released in this spectacular cassette edition (see it here) via Ætergap Productions. As was apparent from their numerous (6) quality demo releases (“Ætt Loka” &amp; “Ursvöl” being their crowning achievements) Panphage is not a one-hit wonder, and “Storm” showcases it in an excellent way.</p>
