I"ê<p>Despite metal‚Äôs obsession with occult aesthetics, its devotional aspect (a function of music that has extremely deep roots, while also being an integral part of religion and the occult) rarely goes beyond superficiality. This has obviously to do with the shock value use of occult in metal, as well as the genre‚Äôs highly individualistic and rebellious spirit (which is obviously intertwined with said shock value). In black metal the situation may well be somewhat different, owning to the genre‚Äôs obsession with the non-mundane and numinous, but still, it is not frequently that we listen to albums which feel genuinely devotional in nature.</p>
