I"Å<p class="indentia">Crepusculo Negro is a label that I have been stalking for some years now, and one I am particularly fond of (as was evident in my last year‚Äôs list, including both Volahn and Arizmenda‚Äôs full-lengths), both due to the quality of its bands, as well as the existence of a unified artistic and spiritual concept among its members, solidified in the Black Twilight Circle. Though not much is clear about the content of this concept, one can be certain of a certain mythological fascination with pre-hispanic Central American civilizations (members appear to be of Mexican-American descend, and strongly influenced by the Mexican legends Xibalba), as the main person behind the Circle has stated. I am quite positive inclined towards black metal becoming occasionally an artistic medium for expression of minorities‚Äô cultural needs, as is the case in this particular case.</p>
