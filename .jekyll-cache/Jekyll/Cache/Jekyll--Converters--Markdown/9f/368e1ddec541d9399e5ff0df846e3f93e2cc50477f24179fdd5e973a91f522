Norway has been less than stellar during the past years, as far as black metal is concerned, and 2016 was no exception. Thankfully there are a few dark twinkles in this sea of mediocrity, as is this EP from Trondheim, which mixes furious majesty with triumphant darkness. Here be hints of early Enslaved mixed with a more down-to-earth approach reminiscent of the turn of the millennium (Tsjuder for instance).<br />

<p><br />
The raw black metal demo of the year could well ride into this list on grace of its amazingly malicious cover alone. The fact that it is also well-versed in the black arts of insectoid-like articulated guitars riffs as well as in that of double-echo vocals and thrashy pauses is only adding points to it, as do both the group name and the releaseâ€™s title.

<p><br />
Ancient Record circlesâ€™ Sir Nâ€™s new project will not surprise those familiar with his other bands (which are not few). Maybe slightly more angular and warm, with an essence of interior spaces. As always, Sir N. knows how to build up traditional â€™90s black metal atmosphere. One more worthy addition to Swedenâ€™s amazing contemporary underground scene.<br />

<p><strong>9. Kaffaljidhma â€“ Î™ &amp; Î™Î™ [demos]</strong><br />

<p><br />
The Dutch Kaffaljidhmaâ€™s first two demos (laconically named â€œIâ€ &amp; â€œIâ€) is an prime example of naturalistic image-crafting music. With hardly any riffs in the traditional sense of the word, they are ambiance floating upon the wandererâ€™s path, a path ravaged by snow and trees. They are a-temporal exercises in meditation, pure atmosphere distilled in two expressively named songs, one in each demo.

<p><strong>8. Duch Czerni â€“ Reality of Black Spirits [demo]</strong><br />

<p><br />
Subterranean, slithering ritualistic black metal from Poland, which crawls elegantly discharging spasms of incense on its chaotic path. Here lie parts of the spirit of Mortuary Drape and Necromantia (more like detached spectres gliding above the music, rather than being incorporated in the songwriting). An excellent specimen of how the Occult can be sculptured in a black metal release.<br />
<br /></p>

<p><strong>7. Light of the Morning Star â€“ Cemetery Glow [EP]</strong><br />
<br /></p>

<p><br />
One cannot go wrong with a De Mysteriis-esque black/purple cover depicting a cemetery. This one-man band from UK is dominated by ominous gothic riffing (with slightly black metal hues) which is highly effective in the creation of a gloomy menacing atmosphere. Throw in the mix a vocal performance which draws upon the -wave monotony, and you have an unexpected dark gem â€“ with a guitar blink at The Cureâ€™s â€œPornographyâ€ just before ending.<br />
<br /></p>

<p><br />
This US band appeared out of nowhere in late September, unleashing 3 demos in less than two weeksâ€™ time, all three releases capturing excellently the forest-walking spirit of early Satyricon, and generally of the mid-â€™90s â€œtraditionalâ€ Norwegian scene. All 3 demos are almost interchangeable as far as a place in this list is concerned, â€œNocturnal Mysticismâ€ just won me a bit more due to the unconventional beginning of its first track.<br />
<br /></p>

<p><br />
The veil of Archaic majesty â€“ manifested through a sound that worships Les Legions Noires â€“ covers this tape masterpiece coming from the Iberian Peninsula. Steeped in occult atmosphere, with surprisingly interesting vocals and grainy guitars that wander through catacombs, with amazing cover art, and a name that revels in its extravagance, this entity seems to have a highly promising future.<br />
<br /></p>

<p><strong>4. Necromantic Worship â€“ The Callingâ€¦ [EP]</strong><br />
<br /></p>
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=258609571/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless=""><a href="http://nuclearwarnowproductions.bandcamp.com/album/the-calling">The Calling... by Necromantic Worship</a></iframe>
<p><br />
Despite its quality, the Dutch mastersâ€™ second demo proved unfortunately to be their last one. Continuing on the Necromantia worship path that they set upon with 2015â€™s monumental â€œSpirit Of The Entrance Unto Death,â€ Necromantic Worship created with â€œThe Callingâ€¦â€ another stellar rendering of the dungeon-ish ritualistic Evil sound of early Necromantia. Of cracking tombs and floating spheres.<br />
<br /></p>

<p><strong>3. Cult of Fire â€“ Life, Sex and Death [EP]</strong><br />
<br /></p>

<p><br />
The Czech trio returned with another killer EP, following on the tradition of the amazing â€œÄŒtvrtÃ¡ symfonie ohnÄ›.â€œ With a deep sense of folk melody integrated throughout the riff structure of the four tracks, this release showcases the ascending progress of the band since its 2013 breakthrough (not forgetting last yearâ€™s Death Karma as well). Melodic, without compromise in its furious moments, and with a level of songwriting that is to be envied, â€œLife, Sex and Deathâ€ is a species of uttermost interest.<br />
<br /></p>

<p><strong>2. Mystik â€“ Af Herrens Mystikâ€¦ (Kapitel I) &amp; Dunkla klangorâ€¦ (Kapitel II) [demos]</strong><br />
<br /></p>

(Kapitel I) by Mystik</a></iframe>
<p><br />
If BekÃ«th NexÃ«hmÃ¼ is a name with which most are well-acquainted, Mystik is an entity that sprouted this year seemingly out of nowhere with two amazing compilations of unreleased demo recordings spanning six years (2009-2014). Their style is as â€™90s as the labelâ€™s aura invokes, reminiscent of a more tense and densely articulated BekÃ«th NexÃ«hmÃ¼. Drawing upon the Scandinavian atmospheric legacy of such names as Ulver, Isvind, Kampfar and Setherial, among many others, the two Kapitels are artifacts of an underground scene that seems to be without equal.<br />

<p><br />
The obscure Swede masters of â€™90s-esque atmospheric black metal unleashed two full-length-duration demos this year, remaining one of the best things (if not the single best) to come out of the Ancient Recordsâ€™ womb. Steeped in the lo-fi nighttime elegance of a spectre wandering in a haunted forest, â€œDe Dunklas Ã…terkomstâ€˜sâ€ 40 minutes are an oasis of nocturnal snowy atmosphere, graced with a sound that is as thin as a ghostâ€™s density.</p>
