I"a<p>This is the third incarnation of a blog that dabbles into all things uncanny, with an emphasis on art and folklore. Reviews of music albums, books, movies and video games; musings on folklore, mythology and the occult; as well as short stories.<br />
Most of the material is in English, with some (especially short stories) texts being in Greek.</p>
