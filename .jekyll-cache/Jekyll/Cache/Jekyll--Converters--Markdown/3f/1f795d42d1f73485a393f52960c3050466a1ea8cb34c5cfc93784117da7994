I"!<p class="indentia">I am very late to the Aickman show; indeed, it was only last year that I learned of him. After a hasty trek through <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/357727.Cold_Hand_in_Mine" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-400"><strong>Cold Hand in Mine</strong></a> it was only last month that I decided to properly start with his bibliography, opting for a chronological order. My impressions concerning the themes of his stories have been quite positive up to now â€“ he seldom uses trite subjects, and when he does he tends to spin them on new directions (see for instance how he uses the dead in <strong>Ringing the Changes</strong>). As for the supernatural, it is subtle, though usually existent. Implicitness is heavy, as is a talent for unusual takes on the macabre.</p>
