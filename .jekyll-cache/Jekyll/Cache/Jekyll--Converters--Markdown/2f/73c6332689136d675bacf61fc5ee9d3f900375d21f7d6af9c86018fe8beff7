I"j<p class="indentia"><strong>Drowning the Light</strong> is a prime example of a band whose discography sheer volume can easily discourage those who have not been following them from the beginning, the “uninitiated” one could say. I find myself among the ranks of this latter group, having been acquainted with the Australian sometime during 2010, 7 years after the band’s formation. 7 years during which Drowning the Light had already released 10 full-length albums, and an even larger number of split/demo/ep releases. I was awed by this massive production, and kept postponing my immersion to their works.</p>
