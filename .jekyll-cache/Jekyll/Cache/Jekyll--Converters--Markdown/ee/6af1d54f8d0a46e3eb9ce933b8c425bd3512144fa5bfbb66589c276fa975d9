I"<p>I saw <a href="http://throneofsalt.blogspot.com/2020/05/build-witch-challenge-maggie-blackthorn.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-400">this challenge at Throne of Salt</a>, originating <a href="https://oicn.icu/2020/build-a-witch-challenge/" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-400">here</a>, and I decided to give it a spin.<br />
<br /></p>

<p><strong>What kind of witch she is?</strong><br />
<br /></p>

<ul>
  <li>She is a bridge witch, dividing her time between the three bridges of her area, dwelling in river caves below them. She exacts tolls, enchants the river flow, retracts the bridges or confuses those who try to traverse them, takes care of the trolls that live underneat.<br />
<br /></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What’s her name?</strong><br />
<br /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Pirwekîl.<br />
<br /></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What kind of wand does she use?</strong><br />
<br /></p>

<ul>
  <li>A crooked staff with a piece of string joining the two horns. If she cuts the string the nearest bridge becomes impassable.<br />
<br /></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What’s in her cauldron?</strong><br />
<br /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Fish, coins, troll teeth, wayfarers’ offerings, stone powder, the words of power for each bridge.<br />
<br /></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What kind of familiar she has?</strong><br />
<br /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Big black toad whose croaks make the moon shiver (it hides behind clouds).<br />
<br /></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Where does she live?</strong><br />
<br /></p>

<ul>
  <li>In each of the three bridges.<br />
<br /></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What does she look like?</strong><br />
<br /></p>

<ul>
  <li>She wears a hooded dress seemingly made of road stone tiles. Her hair are rope, her face is like the darkness beneath a bridge.<br />
<br /></li>
</ul>
