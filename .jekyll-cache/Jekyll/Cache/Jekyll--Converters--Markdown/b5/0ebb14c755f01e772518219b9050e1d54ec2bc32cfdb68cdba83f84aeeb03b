<p>A common topic of conversation among my acquaintances is the concept of â€œFirst album beats all consequent releasesâ€, this universal (at least among the Â«faithfulÂ» ones) law of first album superiority, which is deeply rooted in the heavy metal (sub)conscious. There is a number of reasons behind this notion. Firstly, a bandâ€™s first album is usually the result of years of fermentation, containing material that has been worked on for a serious amount of time, with the bandâ€™s member(s) editing and filtering it through a number of demo/ep/split releases. On the contrary, the next album(s) tend to be released under more pressure, especially if a label is interfering, holding the deadline date as an ominous axe above the bandâ€™s heads. Youthful enthusiasm is another matter that has to be taken into account, considering the age of the bandâ€™s members when it is firstly formed. Beyond that, the music labels often corrode the musiciansâ€™ spirits, as does the exhausting touring. Finally, the success of a debut is a two-edged knife: Your fan base is usually stigmatized by its music direction and style, and can frequently be dogmatic in its devotion to it, unwilling to accept grand-scale changes. Thus is magnified the artistâ€™s reluctance to experiment and follow his creativeness, leading to stagnation and back-to-back similar releases of pure quality.</p>

<p>While I recognize the application of the aforementioned law in multiple cases, I find myself seeking the exceptions to the rule. Thus I made a list of 15 albums -released from relatively well-known black metal bands- which surpassed in quality their debut predecessors. The majority of them are the sophomore albums of their respective bands, a fact leading to the assumption that the first years of a bandâ€™s discographic activity are usually the more essential and fruitful ones.</p>

<p>P.S.: Deathspell Omega is a special case. Their second era, I consider to be the best one by far. There, however, we have a band changed in such a degree that it no longer resembles its past self, even remotely. If I consider them a different band past-â€Si Monumentumâ€ then the first album of the new period rules supreme indeed. Therefore I take into account here only the first two albums of their first (and more traditional) era.</p>

<p><strong>Abigor - Nachthymnen (From The Twilight Kingdom) (1995)</strong><br />
<br /></p>

<p>Austriaâ€™s Abigor debuted with 1994â€™s â€œVerwÃ¼stungâ€, an engaging release as it turned out. But it was their second full-length, â€œNachtmystiumâ€, that really made them transcend the underground. Infused with nocturnal atmosphere, being ice-thin production-wise, it burned with a totally medieval spirit. The bandâ€™s progress was evident in every aspect of the album. â€œScars in the Landscape of Godâ€ is a paramount beauty of a song, whose seal is branded upon the listenerâ€™s memory (the female vocals are simply enchanting). Definitely the bandâ€™s finest moment, one of the flawless examples of mid 90â€™s black metal.<br />
<br />
<strong>Absu â€“The Sun of Tiphareth (1995)</strong><br />
<br /></p>
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3257016619/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless=""><a href="http://osmoseproductions.bandcamp.com/album/the-sun-of-tiphareth">The Sun Of Tiphareth by Absu</a></iframe>

<p>â€œV.I.T.R.I.O.L.â€ was an album of well-played death metal, with a thrashy edge and ritual essence. It was with â€œSun of Tipharethâ€ however, that Absu settled on the music style that made them famous, which can be imperfectly described as black/thrash. Lengthy, complex compositions, full of guitar ideas that disintegrate any signs of weariness. Diversity is apparent through both acoustic passages and tasteful keyboard use (who can ever forget the, a la Emperor, middle part of â€œApzuâ€?). A memorial of an album.<br />
<br />
<strong>Akercocke â€“The Goat of Mendes (2001)</strong><br />
<br /></p>
<iframe class="w-full" height="415" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/irlvoEecw7Q" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Carrying on their backs the alarming â€œRape of the Bastard Nazareneâ€ debut, Akercocke unleashed in 2001 â€œThe Goat of Mendesâ€, a mind-numbing creation. Cinematic black/death, b-movie-esque Satan worship, and an astonishing pair of lead vocals. An intoxicating release, in which you have a very hard time of calling favorite songs (if hard-pressed to choose I would go with â€œA skin for dancing inâ€). Right about the time that the first signs of saturation begun to appear on Cradle of Filthâ€™s body, Akercocke grabbed the UK extreme metal torch and kept it fueled with 3 soon-to-follow, amazing albums.<br />
<br />
<strong>Bathory â€“ Under the Sign of the Black Mark(1987)</strong><br />
<br /></p>
<iframe class="w-full" height="415" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rdj4FgcjrDI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>I am probably the last person to doubt about Bathoryâ€™s 2 first albumsâ€™ quality and influence. Still, in 1987, Quorthon raised his sound to a total new level, by developing the rough chaos of â€œBathoryâ€ and â€œReturn..â€ into atmospheric darkness (â€œ13 Candlesâ€) and genuine epicness (â€œEnter the Eternal Fireâ€ and the second half of â€œEquimanthornâ€), foreshadowing the albums yet to come. Here one can feel the Swedeâ€™s compositional coming-of-age. With â€œUnder the Sign..â€, Quorthon delivers a monumental album, that haunts the first wave of black metal.<br />
<br />
<strong>Burzum â€“ Det Som Engang Var(1993)</strong><br />
<br /></p>
<iframe class="w-full" height="415" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j6AS25g7Ie0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Things get rough now. Vargâ€™s debut is a phenomenal milestone in every aspect (year of release, the emerging style, even the one-man-band motif), equipped with a heavy arsenal on its way to claim the â€œbest Burzum albumâ€ throne. Meanwhile, the masterful â€œHvis Lysset..â€ and â€œFilosofemâ€ releases are locked in a constant arm-wrestling fight, the prize of which is also the aforementioned throne. Somewhere among those 3, lies Vikernesâ€™ second gem, a transitional opus, balanced between past and future. Melody (listen to the last part of â€œKey to the Gateâ€) and sibylline minimalism (â€œSnu Mikrokosmos Tegnâ€) are exquisitely intertwined in this album that tends to be forgotten by the generic Burzum historian, but in my opinion stands above the bandâ€™s self-titled debut.<br />
<br />
<strong>Cradle of Filth â€“ Dusk &amp; her Embrace(1996)</strong><br />
<br /></p>
<iframe class="w-full" height="415" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3nwRPB03PIQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>â€œPrinciple..â€ was a fine album. The â€œVempireâ€ ep as well. It is in â€œDusk &amp; her Embraceâ€ however, Cradleâ€™s sophomore full-length, that the Britishâ€™s style is fully standardized. Gothic black metal which draws heavily from the 80â€™s-heavy-metal well (Mercyful Fate and Maiden influence is apparent in the guitar riffs), MEANINGFUL keyboards, love-them-or-hate-them vocals, and short-novel-like lyrics (infused with Daniâ€™s wit). â€œFuneral in Carpathiaâ€ and â€œGothic Romanceâ€ are songs without an equal. Filthâ€™s capstone, an album that was heavily criticized by â€œtrveâ€ black metallers, most of which would trade both of their eyes for the ownership of even one of the songs herein.<br />
<br />
<strong>Darkthrone â€“ A Blaze in the Northern Sky/Under a Funeral Moon/Transilvanian Hunger(1992-93-94)</strong><br />
<br />
<img src="/assets/images/music/darkthrone123.jpg" alt="Darkthrone" title="Darkthrone" /><br />
<br /></p>

<p>Here be cheating. I honestly cannot bring myself to choose between Darkthroneâ€™s 2nd, 3rd and 4th albums. Each one of them is characterized by a certain style: â€œA Blaze..â€ is otherworldly barrenness personified , gazing upon paths almost transcendent. â€œUnder..â€ is the most down-to-earth one, yet extremely poisonous throughout. â€œTransilvanian..â€ stands grimly alone in its inhuman monotony. â€œSoulside Journeyâ€ was an excellent specimen of technical death metal, but in all seriousness, it can not compete with those 3 black diamonds of unearthly black metal.<br />
<br />
<strong>Deathspell Omega â€“ Inquisitors of Satan(2002)</strong><br />
<br /></p>
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2954619327/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless=""><a href="http://deathspellomega.bandcamp.com/album/inquisitors-of-satan">Inquisitors of Satan by Deathspell Omega</a></iframe>

<p>Concerning the second (and best) era of the French band, I will not say a word here, since the change in style was extremely radical. Concerning the first 2 full-lengths however, I can easily write-off the mediocre debut (â€œInfernal Battlesâ€); â€œInquisitors..â€ is miles ahead. Riffs imbued with the Norwegian soul, extremely passionate (hear Shaxul roaring â€œOur Skies are forever black!â€ on Â«Succubus of all vicesÂ») of temperament, â€œInquisitors..â€ reeks of hellish demonology. Being the peak of their youthful â€œnaive satanicâ€ days, DSOâ€™s second album still spreads its old-school poison.<br />
<br />
<strong>Dodheimsgard â€“ Monumental Possession(1996)</strong><br />
<br /></p>
<iframe class="w-full" height="415" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xkokc9zgUyc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>â€œKronet til Kongeâ€ was nothing special. Being a decent album of traditional black metal, it did not raise much fuss. Enter â€œMonumental Possessionâ€. Dodheimsgard turn deadly serious, splitting their music style in 3 (pure malignant venom/black-thrash/suffocating avant-garde), a thing happening also vocal-wise (Vicotnikâ€™s throat shines, full of half-digested maliciousness). The band sows paranoid thrash storms, reaping apocalyptic nightmares. Here stand Dodheimsgard in their full glory. A few years later this band will bring ferociously down the genre itself.<br />
<br />
<strong>Gehenna â€“ Seen through the Veils of Darkness(1995)</strong><br />
<br /></p>
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3118304709/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless=""><a href="http://cacophonousrecords.bandcamp.com/album/seen-through-the-veils-of-darkness-the-second-spell">Seen Through the Veils of Darkness (The Second Spell) by Gehenna</a></iframe>

<p>The duration of â€œFirst Spellâ€ is a bit deceiving, as far as its categorization is concerned â€“ ep or full-length? Still, the band consider it their first album and who am I to argue? â€œFirst Spellâ€ was a convincing species of â€œGhost metalâ€ (so-called by the band itself), yet it left us craving for more. â€œSecond Spellâ€ was more than satisfying, broadening Gehennaâ€™s musical vision; even some classic heavy metal influence elements can be discerned. The majestic moments are more than convincing, equal to (or surpassing) even the mighty Emperor (listen for instance to the exaltation of â€œThrough the Veils of Darknessâ€, or to the narrative in â€œA Myth..â€). State of the art atmospheric black metal.<br />
<br />
<strong>Immortal â€“ Pure Holocaust(1993)</strong><br />
<br /></p>
<iframe class="w-full" height="415" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dM8wWKS2hF0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>â€œDiabolical Fullmoon Mysticismâ€ is okay. For a debut. But every notion of comparing it to the ice-block by the name of â€œPure Holocaustâ€, is bound to be considered as picturesque as the â€œCall of the Wintermoonâ€ video. The ice-columns are mighty in this album, taller than anything else. Oh haze of â€œUnsilent storms in the Northern Abyssâ€, you were never denser. Since 1993 the Sun no longer rises. Did memory bells ring while listening to the namesake track? The main riff is the Star Wars â€œEmpire themeâ€ played backwards. The following album, â€œBattles in the Northâ€, was highly praised too, but nothing can surpass the somber frost of â€œPure Holocaustâ€.<br />
<br />
<strong>Leviathan â€“ Massive Conspiracy against all life(2008)</strong><br />
<br /></p>
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3113451571/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless=""><a href="http://moribundrecords.bandcamp.com/album/massive-conspiracy-against-all-life">Massive Conspiracy Against All Life by Leviathan</a></iframe>

<p>This being Wrestâ€™s 4th full-length (while the total release count is quite higher). â€œMassive Conspiracy..â€ , his swansong as he led us to believe back then, is â€“ along with â€œLurker of Chaliceâ€ â€“ his most substantial offering to the Genre. Grandiose, majestic, cantankerous structures, a sound many-folded , full of excruciatingly slow parts which give way to redemptive, religious-like speed bursts. The albumâ€™s soul is orthodox, but its rationale is not. â€œMassive conspiracy..â€ stands as a landmark, not only of USBM, but of the whole 00â€™s scene. Mandatory release.<br />
<br />
<strong>Marduk â€“ Opus Nocturne(1994)</strong><br />
<br /></p>
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1856429090/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless=""><a href="http://osmoseproductions.bandcamp.com/album/opus-nocturne">Opus Nocturne by Marduk</a></iframe>

<p>â€œThose of the Unlightâ€, Swedenâ€™s Marduk debut album, was not without personality. Though containing mostly typical black metal, it was graced with a number of catchy melodic songs. Still, â€œOpus Nocturneâ€, their 2nd effort, showed a band with enhanced songwriting skills. Here lies an album bellicose (in a much more convincing and insidious way than â€œPanzer Division Mardukâ€), nocturnal, yet essentially melodic. A cornerstone of Swedish black metal, â€œOpus Nocturneâ€ is filled with memorable songs, cohesion, and flows seamlessly. <br />
<br />
<strong>Satyricon â€“ The Shadowthrone(1994)</strong><br />
<br /></p>
<iframe class="w-full" height="415" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PdW13bQcpPQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>â€œThe Shadowthrone is not Satyriconâ€™s best album. What it is, is a better release than â€œDark Medieval Timesâ€, which was a mighty debut, but was lacking in both the production and composition departments. â€œShadowthroneâ€ kicks off with â€œHvite Krists DÃ¸dâ€, an insuperable tune that showcases the bandâ€™s improvement. There is lots of variety herein, both inside the song structures and the album flow. â€œVikinglandâ€ is Enslaved-inspired viking black, â€œDominions of Satyriconâ€ has a bone-chilling backbone of a riff (wait for it after the first minute). Satyricon evolved their music later on, but Shadowthroneâ€™s polish is indelible.<br />
<br />
<strong>Summoning â€“ Minas Morgul(1995)</strong><br />
<br /></p>

<p>Austria was where this list begun, Austria is where it will end too. Summoning is a sister-band to Abigor. Like them, they debuted with pleasant-yet-unimpressive material (â€œLugburzâ€). 1995â€™s â€œMinas Morgulâ€ shows a changed band. Gone are the pure-black-metal days, sacrificed upon the altar of a soundtrack-esque synth-based sound. Fortunately, the guitars are not impeded by the keyboards. On the contrary, they embroider heart-wrenching, long-paced, mid-tempo riffs, which attach themselves on the listenerâ€™s memory sensors. Following the release of â€œMinas Morgulâ€, their discography was of equal quality, but here is where it all started.</p>
