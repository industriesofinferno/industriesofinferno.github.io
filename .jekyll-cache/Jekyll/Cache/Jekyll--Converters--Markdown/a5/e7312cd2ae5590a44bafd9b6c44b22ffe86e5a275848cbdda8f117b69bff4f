<p class="indentia">A year after Draculaâ€™s destruction, a pale cleric wanders the lands beyond the forest and discovers that there is evil afoot once more.</p>

<p class="indentia">Beginning in the best possible way (with a traditional Romanian childrenâ€™s game), Theoâ€™s impressive graphic novel slowly transmutes into a magmatic torrent which, despite being a tributary of the <strong>Stoker â€œDâ€ Opus</strong>, still meanders in unexpected ways, twisting and flowing with extraordinary passion. The writing (especially when the religious overtones take central stage later on) writhes with the youthful defiance of heavy metal (look for the <strong>Per Ohlin</strong> reference early on, itâ€™s not easy to miss; or the slight <strong>Rotting Christ</strong> tint throughout the later half). On the other hand, Prasidis holds delicately a strong lens upon the three main charactersâ€™ inner worlds, examining them in depth: there are both physical and mental wanderings in this Transylvania of his which has been traumatized in multiple levels.</p>

<p class="indentia">Of especial note are the two protagonistic female characters - they are teeming with strength, self-determination, and initiative â€“ it is pure joy to follow them, even (or especially) in that grim and haunted land. They are what makes Theoâ€™s work an innovative work, since they infuse Draculaâ€™s literary corpse with an air of emancipation and female empowerment which doesnâ€™t feel forced, but rather, well-integrated in the setting.</p>

<p class="indentia">Jodie Muirâ€™s art is spectacular, lush, full of intricate iconography and a great color palette, and brings to vivid life Theoâ€™s world and its feral religiosity. Some of the frames have a timeless, transcendental quality reminiscent of self-sufficient paintings â€“ loved the 2-page spread of the cathedral/castle which draws upon the spirit of ZdzisÅ‚aw BeksiÅ„ski.</p>

<p class="indentia">Despite a few shortcomings (it could be a bit shorter, and some amount of introspection could be replaced with a bit more action) this is a tremendous work, a truly worthy addition to the Dracula corpus. Definitely recommended, and keep an eye out for <a href="https://www.swampdogscomic.net/" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-400">Swamp Dogs</a>, Theoâ€™s ongoing comic, as well as any future projects of his.</p>
