I"ù<p>This is the first of a series of posts describing a small riverside village (which once a year becomes a pilgrimage destination) and the surrounding areas. The settlement is split in two parts by a large chasm; this separation is also mirrored in the unusual social stratification of the population. In my setting the village is on the edge of a large forest, climbing on the foot of some wooded hills, in a secluded valley far from any sizable human civilization ‚Äì the whole valley is very strongly influenced by real world animistic beliefs. (As a sidenote, the village‚Äôs name is a reference to the city of Sirtel, from the namesake Slauter Xstroyes song)</p>
