<p>The fact that Shatraug is a workaholic of disturbing proportions is more or less well known . The guitarist/mastermind of Sargeist currently participates in at least 14(!) active bands. Due to this hotpot of activity, Sargeist were put in a sort of hiatus after the amazing 2010 â€œLet the Devil inâ€ album, not taking into account a split and an ep released in 2011. Last year the band unleashed a compilation of rarities/b-sides, and this year the time came for the release of their 4th full length album, â€œFeeding the Crawling Shadowsâ€.</p>

<p>A few seconds into the album and you realise that there is a definite change here in comparison with its predecessor. The sound is evidently rawer and more lo-fi, and â€“ production-wise â€“ a fuzzy, cavernous point of view dominates the recording. The apparent clarity of â€œLet the Devil inâ€ is missing here. On the new album there is a backtracking for the Finnish, back to the first 2 album aesthetics, a fact also implied by the return of a black and white cover (which remains as â€œpicturesqueâ€ as expected by Sargeist). Those people who got into the band via the previous album, are in for a surprise upon the first spin of the album.</p>

<p>The new album is not so dissimilar from the previous one, as far as composition and riff logic are concerned. The guitars are essentially melodic and (putting the willingly â€œuglyâ€ production aside) quite â€œharmlessâ€(no a bad thing per se). Riffs are safely dominated by a nostalgic temper, they are catchy enough, and they drag the songs onwards without being especially tiresome, despite their repetitive nature. Hoath Torogâ€™s vocals are bathed in an aura of distant resonance, building up efficaciously the albumâ€™s atmosphere. What we have in this record is the classic finnish black metal sound, the one we first met in the late 90â€™s, in the vein of Satanic Warmaster, Horna, Behexen, etc.</p>

<p>To sum it up, Sargeist deliver a noteworthy successor to their magnum opus. The new album isnâ€™t exactly original, its ideas are definitely less inspired than the ones in â€œLet the Devil inâ€, but still it remains a very good specimen of melodic, traditional, lo-fi black metal. Morosely pleasant upon listening, it may be a tad lengthier than needed, but still the fact remains that â€œFeeding the Crawling Shadowsâ€ is evidence of Sargeist still being alive and kicking.<br />
