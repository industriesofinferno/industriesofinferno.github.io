I"!<p class="indentia">We definitely needed a movie steeped in the ominous folklore tapestry of the countryside, which would not resort to cheap tricks like jump scares and bucketloads of gore, tricks completely hostile to the fragile atmosphere of the suggestive horror genre. Aside from the recent Ben Wheatley’s “A Field In In England” (which however moves towards a more psychedelic and alternate consciousness direction) one must go back in time to find decent horror folklore movies. The din created around “The Witch” since last year, way before its official release, after several blazing reviews and the claim of American Sundance Festival’s director award, made it a film to definitely be looking forward to. And it seems that it almost flawlessly lives up to our expectations.</p>
