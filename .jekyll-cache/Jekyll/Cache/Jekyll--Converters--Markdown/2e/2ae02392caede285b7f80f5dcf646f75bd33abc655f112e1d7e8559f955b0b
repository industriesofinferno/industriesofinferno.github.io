<p class="indentia">Vivus Humare, a band formed in 2007 but having only a demo (2008â€™s â€œPrologâ€) in their arsenal, is a prime example of mismatching visual aesthetic vibes. On one hand, the band membersâ€™ photos are suggestive of a â€œmodernâ€ and almost comical, Borgir-esque approach, which I personally find unattractive. But then one gazes upon the wonderful album cover, with the parchment-like texture and the ink drawing, full into the spirit of antiquated black metal, and the scales shift towards a positive appreciation of the bandâ€™s visual image.</p>

<p class="indentia">â€œEinkehrâ€ is not a lengthy album, its duration just barely over 35 minutes. Of its music direction, one could abstractly place it amidst the depressive and atmospheric sub-genres, balanced on an occult and subterranean edge. The bandâ€™s focus on soundscapes of tangible darkness is evident throughout the album, especially in the final track, â€œTraumâ€, which has drunk deeply of the â€œDe Mysteriis..â€ chalice. In contrast to other bands of the sub-genres in question, Vivus Humare do not falter on the speed spectrum, navigating tempestuous, blastbeating seas as well as placid, mid-tempo waters. Guitar riffology is fluent in repetitive expression, of an atmospheric, almost dungeon-like hue. Of special note are the clean vocals, injected throughout a large portion of the record; while the typical, black-metal-ish ones are prevalent, the fervid character of the former makes them quite functional in the building of atmospheric tension. The tracksâ€™ compositional style is mainly concerned with shifting between passionate blitzkrieg and spacious, shadowy, slow parts; both in micro-(inside each of the three â€œmainâ€ tracks) and macro-scale, though diversity is not to be missed. The Australian atmospheric black metal scene comes into mind, specifically bands as Moon, Drowning the Light, and Pestilential Shadows.</p>

<p class="indentia">Vivus Humare debut is a solid piece of work, which, although could certainly improve on the diversity-of-composition compartment, creating a greater array of memorable moments, is nevertheless far above the average album of this particular BM sound. Personally, I consider the dark, skeletal majesty of â€œTraumâ€ as the way to go on their follow-up releases. â€œEinkehrâ€ is an excellent companion to nocturnal wanderings, imaginative or not.</p>
